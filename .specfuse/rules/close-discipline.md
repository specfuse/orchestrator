# Rule: close discipline

Three obligations for `close` and `close-intermediate` WUs, binding at close
time. Sibling of [`planning-discipline.md`](planning-discipline.md) (plan/arm
time) and of the per-WU closing obligations in
[`result-contract.md`](result-contract.md). Provenance: FEAT-2026-0049
(the specfuse-generator dogfood), where three gates auto-closed at
`attempts: 0` and the one close forced to run caught two false-`done` WUs and
an unsatisfiable predicate — 48% of the feature's spend landed after the
terminal gate had already "auto-closed". A close that only writes prose
verifies nothing.

A close whose acceptance criteria include ANY obligation below is
**load-bearing**: the plan author sets `auto_close_disabled: true` in that
WU's frontmatter so the auto-close predicate cannot optimize it away (#189).

## 1. Oracles re-run fresh

The close re-runs every oracle the feature's acceptance criteria name — the
full test command(s), plus any compile/execution gates — fresh, in this
session, exit codes read directly. Never inherit a producing WU's
self-report: `done` is a claim, the re-run is the verification. What may be
inherited is narrower and stated in §5: on a **re-close** of the same gate, a
`narrow` criterion's green recorded in `GATE-NN-CRITERIA.md` by an earlier
close attempt is carried forward; every `broad` oracle and the gate's
`feature_oracle` re-run on every attempt. "Fresh" binds the first close of a
gate in full, and the broad half of every close after it — never a producing
unit's own report. When the
feature's criteria assert on generated artifacts, regenerate into a clean
output directory before asserting — stale output satisfies any assertion.

**The gate's `feature_oracle` is the feature-level re-run, not one more unit
oracle.** Re-running every producing unit's own oracle is a different, weaker
question: `[FEAT-2026-0057/G1-CLOSE/feature-oracle-is-a-different-question]`
records a close where fifteen unit oracles re-ran green and none could
observe the defect, because none asserted on the path the feature was meant
to change. A gate's `GATE-NN.md` may declare one `feature_oracle` — the
composite question the units were each too small to ask. When it does, the
close re-runs it fresh, same as any other oracle above, and records its
verdict as a `### feature_oracle: PASS` or `### feature_oracle: FAIL` line in
`## Measurements`. `specfuse lint --closing` fails a close that omits this
line when the gate declares an oracle (`close-n`,
`check_feature_oracle_verdict_recorded` in `closing_requirements.py` /
`lint_closing.py`); a gate that declares no `feature_oracle` imposes no such
requirement here — see this rule's "What the driver checks" section and T03
for whether an absent declaration is itself a finding.

> **Provenance.** A WU reported `done` while its source was untouched and its

**You measure; the judge concludes (FEAT-2026-0100).** Re-running the oracles
is your job and it does not change. Deciding what their exit codes *mean* for
the feature is not: on a terminal gate the driver dispatches a separate judge
session once your close has passed its deliverable guards, and that session
writes the verdict the flips read. It is given the gate's definition of done,
the per-criterion state, the gate's diff, and your `## Measurements` section —
and deliberately not your `## Verdict` or `## Retrospective`, which are
stripped from its evidence before it sees them. It may lower `met` to
`not_met`; it may never raise a `not_met`. So write the measurements, in full,
with commands and exit codes, and treat your own `verdict:` as advisory: a
close that argues for its conclusion instead of evidencing it has given the
judge nothing to read.

**A close work unit's body must not name the verdict it expects.** "Record
`verdict: met` once the suite is green" pre-decides the one question the judge
exists to answer independently, and a session told what to conclude will
conclude it — the reason the judge is a fresh session in the first place. A
close body names what to measure and what evidence counts, never what value to
write. Naming the verdict in the body is a drafting defect, not a shortcut.

## 1a. Which obligations are conditional (FEAT-2026-0106)

Not every obligation above binds on every close. The reflective sections —
`## Cost analysis` and `### Failure-class breakdown` — are conditional on
`gate_eval`'s off-plan signal (a blocked WU, a `replan` event, a cost
overrun): an on-plan close skips them. Measurements are not conditional on
anything, for the reason stated in §1 — the judge's evidence bundle slices
`## Measurements` out of `RETROSPECTIVE.md` regardless of how the gate went,
so a close that skipped writing them would starve the judge of the evidence
it needs to reach a verdict at all. `docs/methodology.md` §6 "Ceremony
proportionality" states the same off-plan signal at the gate-dispatch level
(whether a close runs at all); this section is the narrower case of a close
that does run still skipping prose the gate didn't earn.

## 2. The verdict is binary; unfinished work is tracked, not hedged

The verdict a close records is `met` or `not_met` — there is no partial
credit, and on a terminal gate §1's judge is what settles which of the two
stands. On `not_met` the close writes `FOLLOW-UPS.md` in the feature folder,
one `### `-headed entry per failed criterion carrying the criterion verbatim,
the evidence (the command run and its exit code or output line), and the
re-run condition that would satisfy it; after the close passes, the driver
files one tracked `specfuse:follow-up` issue per entry and writes the issue
number back. A criterion that needs a person to reply, sign, click, or run
something interactively is a `type: human` work unit placed *before* the
close — the driver halts on it, the operator marks it `done` with
`evidence:`, and the close quotes that evidence — and a criterion that can
only be observed in production is a `## Post-merge checklist` line in
`PLAN.md`, filed as one `specfuse:post-merge` issue at close, never an
acceptance criterion.

`close-m` is the guard: a `not_met` close whose `FOLLOW-UPS.md` is absent or
carries no `### ` entry is refused as `closing_deliverable_missing`, pre-squash
and by `specfuse lint --closing`. `gh` being absent or failing leaves the file
itself as the record; the driver never deletes or rewrites it.

> **Provenance (FEAT-2026-0085).** Across 273 features in 12 repositories, 48%
> of verdict-bearing closes ended on one of the two soft-success verdicts this
> feature retired, and 59 of those were later flipped to `met` by an
> acceptance skill with nothing re-run. Of 101 hedged features, 42 hedged
> because a criterion asked the loop to observe production, 16 because a human
> had to sign or act, and 9 because auto-closed gates had seeded every
> criterion into the retrospective as debt the terminal close could not
> reconcile — the three cases the three channels above now carry honestly.
> Only about 13 carried information a hedge is for, and no surveyed external
> loop uses partial credit. The retired values stay *readable* on disk;
> `docs/methodology.md` § Migrating a hedged close says what to do with a
> standing hedged close.

## 3. Consumer-visible contract changes enumerated, human-acknowledged

The close enumerates every consumer-visible addition, removal, or rename the
feature makes across ALL its producing WUs — API surface, generated models,
published schemas, CLI flags, whatever contract consumers depend on — and
blocks on explicit human acknowledgment of the list. A feature with no such
changes writes exactly: `n/a — no consumer-visible contract change` (do not
fabricate an empty enumeration; the n/a line is the reviewed claim).

A close carrying this obligation is always load-bearing
(`auto_close_disabled: true`).

**Also append it to `CHANGELOG.md`'s `Unreleased` section (FEAT-2026-0064).**
When this section is a real enumeration — not the `n/a` line — the close
appends each item to `Unreleased`, classified `added` / `changed` / `fixed` /
`breaking` and carrying the feature's `FEAT-YYYY-NNNN` ID, via
`specfuse/loop/changelog.py`'s schema. **This is the same material the
paragraph above already requires you to write, put where a consumer will
read it — not a second write.** An author who treats the changelog append as
new work will write the enumeration twice, badly; write it once, in both
places, from the same understanding. `closing_requirements.py`'s `close-k`
requirement (enforced by `assert_changelog_entry_for_contract_changes` in
`loop.py`, and pre-squash by `specfuse lint --closing`) fires when this
section names a real change and `Unreleased` gained no entry tracing to this
feature's FEAT-ID.

**An `n/a` close appends nothing to `Unreleased`, and that is correct.** A
changelog padded with "no user-facing change" entries is noise that trains
readers to skip it — the `close-k` check does not fire on an `n/a` section.

> **Provenance.** A breaking removal from a generated model survived four
> gates unreviewed because no close surface owned the breaking-change list.
> A silent breaking change is the most expensive false-done, and it is not
> language-specific — any generated or published contract has this surface.

## 4. What the driver checks — check it before you report, not after you fail

Sections 1–3 are obligations you reason about. The driver additionally
refuses a closing WU that produces correct content in the wrong shape, and it
refuses it *after* the WU has run — so a mismatch used to cost a full
re-dispatch, not a re-arm.

That used to mean memorizing a table of literal guard strings. It no longer
does. Two mechanical surfaces replace the table:

- **The skeleton is pre-created at dispatch.** Every `close` /
  `close-intermediate` / `plan-next` WU starts its session with the
  guard-required files and headings already scaffolded in place
  (`RETROSPECTIVE.md`, the `## Gate <N>` / `## Cost analysis` /
  `### Failure-class breakdown` sections, the `GATE-{N+1}-REVIEW.md`
  filename) — see `precreate_dispatch_skeleton` in `specfuse/loop/loop.py`.
  You fill the skeleton in; you do not need to remember its shape from
  scratch.
- **`specfuse lint --closing` is the mandatory pre-report check.** Run it
  before emitting your `RESULT` block. It reads the same registry the driver
  itself checks and reports pass/fail per requirement in-session, so a format
  mismatch is caught while you can still fix it, not after the driver refuses.

The registry of record — every guard, what it requires, which WU types it
applies to — lives in `specfuse/loop/closing_requirements.py`. That module
and `specfuse/loop/lint_closing.py` (the `--closing` implementation) are the
one place these requirements are enumerated; this rule does not duplicate
them.

**Migration posture.** Already-drafted features need no conversion — the
skeleton applies at dispatch time for any WU dispatched from here forward,
regardless of when its body was authored. Older WU bodies that restate guard
strings inline (pre-dating this section) are inert, not wrong: the driver
never read that prose, only the actual artifacts. Removing such prose from an
old WU body is optional cleanup, not required migration work.

> **Provenance (issue #265, FEAT-2026-0054).** Guard requirements are
> enforced in `specfuse/loop/loop.py`'s `assert_*` functions. They were
> briefly literal-string-documented in this rule (28% of closing-WU spend
> going to driver-refused attempts, three undocumented guards accounting for
> 45% of that waste) — but a second copy of the requirements drifts, so
> FEAT-2026-0054 replaced the copy with the two mechanical surfaces above and
> made `closing_requirements.py` the single registry both the driver and the
> lint read.

## 5. Per-criterion state and the narrow/broad oracle contract

A gate may carry a `GATE-NN-CRITERIA.md` artifact recording, per acceptance
criterion, which oracle proved it, that oracle's exit code, and the tree state it
ran against. Each entry also carries a `kind` (`narrow` or `broad`) and a `state`
(the pass/fail result the oracle produced).

A `narrow` oracle has a knowable scope — a scoped test nodeid, a symbol-existence
import, a structural assert, a grep with a countable output — so its green may be
carried forward across close attempts. A `broad` oracle — the full test suite, a
full regeneration, a scenario matrix — has no knowable scope, so a carried-forward
green would be an unsound coverage claim; it re-runs on every close attempt.

`kind` and `state` are written by the close that ran the oracle and are never
inferred by a reader, the same posture §2 already takes on the hedged-record
`kind:`. `specfuse lint --closing` is the check.

**A carried `narrow` green is invalidated when the criterion's covered paths
changed since it was proved.** Each entry may carry a driver-seeded `covers:`
— the path(s) its oracle actually exercises. On a re-close, a carried entry's
`narrow` green is invalidated (re-measured, not trusted) when the gate diff
since that entry's `proved_at_sha` touches a path in its `covers:`. A
criterion with no derivable `covers:` is never carried — it re-measures on
every close attempt, the same as a `broad` entry. A carried entry also
carries `carried_from_attempt`, the attempt number whose run proved it. A
re-close's `## Measurements` states how much of the gate's state was inherited
versus fresh: `carried forward: N criteria, re-measured: M`.

## Split with project-local rules

These are the generic obligations. The concrete grounding — which command is
the oracle, which surface is "the API", project-specific regeneration
hazards — is per-project and belongs in that project's
`.specfuse/rules-local/` (never touched by upgrade), referencing this rule.
