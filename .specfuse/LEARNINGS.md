# LEARNINGS

Durable, reusable rules distilled from every gate's retrospective. The `lessons` work
unit appends here; planning reads here before detailing any new feature. This is the
feedback loop that makes each plan better than the last.

Append only. Phrase each entry as a rule that would change how a FUTURE work unit is
written or executed, not a one-off observation. De-duplicate against what is here.
Feature-specific observations stay in that feature's `RETROSPECTIVE.md` and are not
promoted here.

## Format

```
- [FEAT-YYYY-NNNN/G1] Implementation WUs must name the module a new route/handler
  lives in; "add it to the router" cost a blocked attempt when no router existed yet.
```

## Entries

<!-- lessons work units append below this line -->
<!--
The entries below are GENERIC methodology lessons that ship with the scaffold —
they are about how to write and run work units, not about any one project. Your
project's own `lessons` work units append project-specific rules beneath them.
-->

- [meta/first-live-use] Scope a feature's acceptance criteria to the feature's
  own footprint — its slug, the paths it creates or edits, the symbols it
  introduces. Acceptance criteria that grep or scan the WHOLE repo will trip
  on pre-existing, unrelated state and (correctly) cause the agent to emit
  `status: blocked` even when the WU's own work is fine. Example failure mode:
  a "no TODO comments anywhere in the tree" check that fires on legacy code
  the WU never touches. Rule: bound checks to the feature's path prefixes
  (e.g. `src/<slug>/**`) or to files the WU declares in `generated_surfaces` /
  `files_changed`; repo-wide invariants belong in a separate hygiene WU or in
  the repo's `code` gate set, not in a per-feature acceptance criterion.

- [meta/first-live-use] Name what the WU is expected to PRODUCE, not only what
  it must NOT touch. The "Do not touch" section bounds the WU on one side;
  without an equally-explicit "produces" list, an agent can helpfully write
  files that should belong to a later WU (e.g. docs that were T92's job
  showing up in T01's commit) without the verification gates objecting. Rule:
  in addition to the "Do not touch" list, the WU's Acceptance criteria should
  name the specific files/sections the WU is expected to author. A reviewer
  reading the diff should be able to point at every changed file and find it
  in either the WU's produces-list or the gate's verification output.

- [meta/first-live-use] The "hygiene WU" pattern — when a substantive WU
  discovers a pre-existing bug in a path its "Do not touch" rule forbids
  (typical case: shared module, infrastructure config, dependency version),
  the right move is to insert a narrow hygiene WU EARLIER in the gate (or as
  a precursor gate) that fixes only that issue. Not: loosen the blocked WU's
  scope to permit the cross-cutting fix (muddies its boundary). Not: fix it
  manually out-of-loop and pretend the gate ran clean (silent drift between
  the methodology's history and git's). The hygiene WU should have a single,
  obvious acceptance criterion and pass on its own verification; the original
  blocked WU then runs after, unmodified.

- [meta/loop-driver-bugs] Driver bookkeeping (frontmatter status flips,
  events.jsonl appends, per-attempt notes) must be committed if it should
  survive across WUs — uncommitted writes are wiped by the inter-attempt
  `git reset --hard`. Agent-work commits (per-WU squash) are separate from
  bookkeeping commits (`chore(loop): ...`). When authoring WUs whose
  verification commands themselves write to disk, remember the agent's
  working tree is reset between failed attempts — scratch files written
  during a failed attempt won't persist into the next attempt's prompt unless
  the agent explicitly buffers them in the prompt-facing failure note the
  driver hands to the next attempt.
