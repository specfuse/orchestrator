# Gate 1 — <name of the milestone this gate proves>

## Definition of done

- Every implementation work unit in this gate is `done`.
- A retrospective exists (feature-local `RETROSPECTIVE.md`).
- Generalizable lessons are promoted to `.specfuse/LEARNINGS.md`.
- Documentation and roadmap status reflect what was actually built.
- The next gate's work units are drafted, and `GATE-NN-REVIEW.md` is written.
- Per-criterion state and the narrow/broad oracle contract: `close-discipline.md` §5.

The closing sequence (retrospective → lessons → docs → plan-next) is part of every
gate and is enforced by the linter. The driver runs the gate unattended, then stops
here for human review-and-arm: read the review artifact, accept or edit the drafted
next-gate work units, flip the accepted ones to `pending`, set this gate's status to
`passed`, and re-run.

## Arming discipline (see `.specfuse/rules/planning-discipline.md`)

Before flipping this gate's next-gate WUs to `pending`:

- **Runtime probe for a default/severity flip (§4).** If any WU in the gate being armed
  flips a **default value** or a **severity**, it may **not** be armed on "mechanical,
  nothing design-open." Apply the change locally, run the **exact command the WU's tests
  gate will run** (the full oracle, not a subset), and paste the failure list into
  `GATE-NN-REVIEW.md`. That list becomes the WU's enumerated test surface. Arming such a
  gate without a probe is what makes an implementation WU spin on a defect one local run
  would have shown.
- **Flag-scope table (§3).** If a WU introduces or flips a behavior flag, confirm it
  carries a flag-scope table and that the feature's headline claim matches it.
- **Escalation-predicate satisfiability (§2).** If a WU raises a check to `ERROR` or
  asserts a "zero issues" predicate, confirm PLAN.md answered "what does the rule report
  on a correct input" and that the answer is zero.

## Reflection notes

<Written by the human at review time. What surprised you, what you changed in the
drafted next gate and why, anything the retrospective got wrong. This is your record,
not the agent's — keep it honest.>
