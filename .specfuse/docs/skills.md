# Skills catalog

The loop ships a set of Claude Code skills — interactive, conversational
operations you invoke as `/skill-name` inside Claude Code. They are the human
side of the gate cycle: the driver (`loop.py`) runs unattended *within* a gate;
the skills are how you plan features, arm gates, diagnose halts, and wrap up.

Every skill is **propose-and-confirm**: it reads state, shows you what it intends
to do, and writes only on your explicit go-ahead. None of them dispatch agent
sessions or run the loop — they manipulate the durable files (`roadmap.md`,
`PLAN.md`, `GATE-NN.md`, `WU-*.md`, `LEARNINGS.md`) that the driver then acts on.

All skills below ship as the `specfuse@specfuse` Claude Code plugin (enable once
with `/plugin marketplace add specfuse/specfuse` then `/plugin install
specfuse@specfuse`; `specfuse init` wires the plugin into the repo's
`.claude/settings.json`). They appear under the `/specfuse:` namespace — no files
are copied into your repo.

## The lifecycle, in order

A feature moves through these phases. The skill for each phase is named.

```

### 1. Pick — choose the next feature

- **`/pick-feature`** — read the roadmap and `LEARNINGS.md`, surface 2–3
  candidates for the next pull with hat-based trade-offs, recommend one. On your
  pick, flips status `planned → active` and prints the next command. Hands off to
  `/draft-feature`.
- **`/roadmap-add`** — add a new feature row to the roadmap before it's ready to
  pick.
- **`/block-feature`** — flip a roadmap feature to `blocked` (or clear it) with a
  linked `**Blocked by.**` blocker — an ADR awaiting approval or an upstream
  FEAT-ID that must complete first. Writes the row status, the detail block, and
  PLAN frontmatter, keeping intra-page feature links resolvable.
  `/block-feature FEAT-ID --unblock` clears the block and restores the status.

### 2. Draft — turn a picked feature into a runnable gate

- **`/draft-feature`** — interactively draft a feature: read roadmap + LEARNINGS +
  exemplars + the project itself, ask framing questions wearing multiple hats,
  propose the gate skeleton and gate 1's work units, write the folder only on
  accept, then lint. Delegates per-WU craft to `authoring-work-units`.
- **`authoring-work-units`** — reference, not an interactive flow: the rules for
  filling the five-section WU contract well, each tied to a real failure mode.
  Read it while drafting or reviewing WUs.
- **`/derive-verification`** — draft a `.specfuse/verification.yml` for a project
  by inspecting its CI, tooling manifests, and code. Run this once when
  bootstrapping the loop in a repo that already has CI worth deriving gates from.
- **`/derive-monitoring`** — draft a `.specfuse/monitoring.yml` (plus a local
  overrides file and a filled secrets checklist) for a project by discovering
  deployed components from repo evidence and auditing them against the
  design-for-diagnosis rule. Run this once a project has real components to
  monitor.

### 3. Run — the driver (not a skill)

`specfuse run` (the pip-installed driver) walks the active gate, dispatches each
WU as a fresh session, verifies, and commits. It is a command, not a skill. It
either auto-closes a clean gate or halts at the gate boundary for review.

It also owns every terminal flip (gate → `passed`, roadmap row → `done`, PLAN.md →
`done`, auto-archive) — no skill writes those surfaces. When a verdict is upgraded
*after* its close WU is already `done`, re-fire them with
`specfuse run --recheck-verdict <FEATURE_ID>`: it re-reads the terminal close WU's
verdict from disk and flips only if it now permits, printing why when it does not.
Safe to run on a feature whose verdict does not permit the flips — it writes
nothing. This is also how a migrated legacy hedged close gets its flips: edit
the verdict to `met` or `not_met`, then re-fire.

### 4. Arm — the human checkpoint at each gate

- **`/arm-gate`** — at a gate boundary (driver halted with `awaiting_review`, next
  gate's WUs in `draft`), walk each drafted WU accept / revise / reject, flip
  statuses, mark the completed gate `passed`, and print the resume command. This
  is the methodology's central human checkpoint, made fast.

### 5. Diagnose — when the loop halts on a problem

- **`/gate-status`** — "where do we stand?" Read-only. Walks the current gate's WU
  statuses, `events.jsonl`, and per-attempt notes; synthesizes a per-blocked-WU
  diagnosis: what's blocked, likely root cause, options, recommended action. Run
  this first when the driver stops unexpectedly.
- **`/unblock-wu`** — re-arm one or more `blocked_human` WUs after you fix the
  underlying cause (credentials, spec ambiguity, missing dep). Flips
  `blocked_human → pending`, resets attempts, re-opens the gate if needed, prints
  the resume command.
- **`/answer-escalation`** — work the `needs-human` GitHub queue one issue at a
  time. Reads one parked escalation, explains in plain English what stopped the
  agent, and records one of four dispositions: **hand off** to the skill that
  owns the escalation's category, **answer** with guidance recorded as a marked
  issue comment, **close** as won't-fix, or **skip**. Every disposition except
  `skip` releases the `needs-human` *and* `blocked-wu` labels — both, because
  `BugsProvider` skips an issue carrying either, so releasing one leaves the
  issue answered and still parked. Human-invoked only; it triggers no fix and no
  retry. Its product is guidance the next agent run reads, carried in a comment
  marked `<!-- specfuse:operator-guidance id=… -->` so a later reader can find it
  mechanically. Write order is deliberate — comment first, labels second — so a
  failed label release leaves an issue correctly answered and merely still
  parked, never unparked with no guidance.
- **`/abandon-feature`** — cleanly abandon the active feature when retry isn't
  worth it. Flips every non-terminal WU/gate/PLAN/roadmap surface to its
  abandoned state behind a single up-front confirmation.

### 6. Wrap — finish a done feature

- **`/wrap-feature`** — after the terminal gate is `done`, push the feature
  branch, open a PR, optionally watch CI, and point at the next pick. Refuses if
  PLAN.md isn't `done` yet. There is no skill that softens a verdict to get past
  that refusal: a close either records `met`, or records `not_met` and leaves
  `FOLLOW-UPS.md` behind for the loop to file as tracked issues.
- **`/roadmap-archive`** — move a done or abandoned feature's detail section from
  `roadmap.md` to `roadmap-archive.md`, leaving a back-link.

## Cross-cutting

- **`verification`** — the run-and-report-the-gates skill. The same verification
  the driver runs as its exit oracle, available to invoke directly when you want
  to confirm a WU is actually complete before declaring done. Read
  [`methodology.md` §5](methodology.md) for why verification — not the agent's
  self-report — decides done.
- **`/fix-bug`** — triage and fix a reported bug *outside* the feature
  methodology: 1 bug = 1 branch = 1 PR, test-first. Refuses and proposes
  promoting to a feature if the work is large or risky.
- **`/diagnose-issue NN`** — read a harvester finding issue and the component
  source it implicates, then post one structured diagnosis comment: root cause,
  evidence trail, candidate fix, plus machine-readable `confidence` and
  `fix_scope`. It diagnoses; it does not decide whether to fix anything. Runs
  interactively, or headlessly via `python3 -m specfuse.monitor.diagnose_cli`,
  which renders through the same renderer so both entry points emit a
  byte-identical body. Nothing fires it automatically yet — the per-component
  `diagnose: auto` dial is a separate, later feature.
- **`/feature-conversion`** — bring an existing feature folder into conformance
  with the current scaffold's structural contract. Runs after `specfuse upgrade`
  flags a feature as `FAIL`. Interactive, lint-driven.
- **`/scaffold-upgrade`** — dry-run-reports or end-to-end upgrades a target
  project's Specfuse scaffold via `specfuse upgrade [--dry-run] <target>`,
  wrapping the git choreography (branch/commit/push/PR/CI/merge-gate) around it.
- **`/learnings-suggest`** — scan `attempt_outcome` events across features,
  cluster non-passing attempts, and surface recurring patterns as candidate
  `LEARNINGS.md` entries. Read-only — you promote. The *additive* half.
- **`/learnings-curate`** — the *compaction* half. `LEARNINGS.md` is loaded whole
  into every planning session, so it must stay bounded. This skill clusters
  duplicate / superseded / over-broad entries and, on your per-cluster accept,
  merges duplicates, retires superseded entries into `LEARNINGS-archive.md`, and
  promotes methodology-wide rules into `.specfuse/rules/*.md`. Mirrors
  `roadmap-archive` for the lessons feedback loop. It never archives an entry just
  because its origin feature is done — provenance is not scope.
- **`/adopt-feature`** — scaffold a dispatchable feature folder from a GitHub
  `specfuse:feature` issue (orchestrator integration). Pairs with
  `.specfuse/scripts/gh_features.py` (discover candidates) and
  `adopt_feature.py`.
